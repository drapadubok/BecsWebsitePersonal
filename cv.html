<div class="minititlelorange" style="text-align:center"><font size="3">And here is more detailed story about me as a professional.</font></div> 
<div class="lorange">
<div class="cvtitle">Scientist</div>
	<div class="cvtext">
I feel best when facing complex challenges, with no readily identifyable solution. The type of challenges that make me feel like saying ”Try me!”. I'm inspired by possibility to learn and adopt new knowledge and technologies. I feel comfortable when faced with new questions that require learning new algorithms, analytic techniques and mindsets. In the new working environment, I'm not just bringing the skills and knowledge, but my work ethic, I'm autonomous, proactive and efficient, able to take the hits and failures and keep going even when inevitable complications arise, while keeping the spirit high.
	</div>
<div class="cvtitle">Jack of all trades</div>
	<div class="cvtext">

I also am a multi-instrumentalist in terms of my skill selection. Over the years I had to learn several programming languages, learn to be better at software development and engineering, had to teach statistics and design multiple experiments, analytic approaches and visualizations, and manage research projects. I love statistical modeling and building apps and tools with python. A dream job for me will allow me to grow both as a data analyst and software engineer and solve real world analytic challenges that make people happier. 

<br><br>
I have a lot of hands-on experience with:
<br><br>
<div class="cvtext">
<l>
  <li>Data mining and cleaning</li>
  <li>Data visualization</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
  <li>Predictive analytics</li>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Statistics</li>
</l>
<br>
	</div>

Currently I'm learning more about web development and interface design to be able to transfer some of my tools to the web and allow people to interact with them without digging into the code.

<br><br>
<div class="minititlelorange" style="text-align:center"><font size="3">My main competencies</font></div> 
<div class="cvtitle">Data analysis</div>
<div class="cvtext">After several years of studying how brains of interacting individuals work by analyzing fMRI data with statistical modeling and machine learning, I learned how to collect, manipulate and inspect large data sets (~100gb – 1tb scale), process them with highly paralellized pipelines and analyze them to derive relevant insights. I can use these skills to extract and clean data, analyse patterns to reveal what do people like and dislike from the data that comes with their activity or predict how a trend may develop.</div>


<div class="cvtitle">Data mining and visualization infrastructure</div>
I've built several analytic pipelines, which include data storage, processing, analysis and visualizations. One of my main principles is ability of third person to understand both the code and the mechanism of pipeline, so clean and readable code, as well as intuitive explanation – are my priorities. I used cluster computing potential that was present in Aalto University to create multiple analytic utilities that took advantage of parallelization, saving massive amount of laboratory time by running the analysis that would normally take several days in half an hour. I strive to make the tools reusable by other people, including ones without solid technical background.


<div class="cvtitle">Software development</div>
My tools for running pattern classification algorithms, general linear models and fMRI data preprocessing were used by both my laboratory and collaborators. I use Python, Matlab and R for predictive modeling, machine learning and data mining and cleaning, and use Git as version control system. I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases and can build simple web applications using Flask. I am an experienced Linux user and feel most comfortable in Linux and Mac OS environments.


<div class="cvtitle">Project management</div>
My work as a PhD candidate allowed me to design, plan and carry out multiple research projects, involving experiment planning, data collection, analysis, writing and reporting. I was actively participating in filling the laboratory wiki, providing utilities to collaborators and introducing new people to our tool-kits and practices. I successfully met deadlines and was able to keep up with project schedule even when faced with multiple complications.


<div class="cvtitle">Communications</div>
Every project I was working on was concluded by scientific research article. After writing several research papers now published in high-profile journals, I acquired good written communication skills. I presented my research at multiple international conferences in talks and poster sessions. I'm confident and comfortable at speaking in front of people, and enjoy using intuitive explanations and metaphors to help listeners' understanding of the topic.


<div class="cvtitle">Teamwork</div>
My projects involved collaboration with psychologists, statisticians, physicians and neuroscientists, which allowed me to enhance my skills in making very different kind of specialists work together efficiently. I'm tactful and persuasive communicator and leader with strong feeling of personal responsibility. I thrive in environment where a lot of collaboration with heterogenous specialists is possible. In my work with colleagues I am able to take responsibility and lead the way, but also am keen and ready to find compromises and believe that mistakes are one of the best ways to learn. I communicate well both with very technically minded and also individuals with more abstract, artistic and humanitarian backgrounds. Finally, I like to be surrounded by smarter people.

<div class="cvtitle">Teaching</div>
I assisted in teaching several courses at university, and am happy to share my knowledge and skills. I'm patient and attentive, am capable of transforming complex concepts into intuitive examples and explanations. I enjoy public speaking and telling stories to highlight teaching material.
